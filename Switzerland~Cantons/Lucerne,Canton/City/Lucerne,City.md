> Lucerne (English:  loo-SURN) or **Luzern** (Swiss Standard German: [luˈtsɛrn] ) 
> is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. 
> 
> Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne 
> and part of the district of the same name. 
> With a population of approximately 82,000 people, 
> Lucerne is the most populous city in Central Switzerland, 
> and a nexus of economics, transport, culture, and media in the region. 
> The city's urban area consists of 19 municipalities 
> and towns with an overall population of about 220,000 people.
> 
> Owing to its location on the shores of Lake Lucerne (German: Vierwaldstättersee) 
> and its outflow, the river Reuss, within sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, 
> Lucerne has long been a destination for tourists. 
> One of the city's landmarks is the Chapel Bridge (German: Kapellbrücke), 
> a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century.
>
> The official language of Lucerne is German, 
> but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, 
> Lucerne German.

> Since 1848, the Swiss Confederation has been a federal republic of relatively autonomous cantons, 
> some of which have a history of federation that goes back more than 700 years, 
> putting them among the world's oldest surviving republics.
>
> The early history of the region is tied to that of Alpine culture. 
> Switzerland was inhabited by the Helvetii, and it came under Roman rule in the 1st century BC. 
> 
> The Gallo-Roman culture was amalgamated with Germanic influence during late antiquity, 
> with the eastern part of Switzerland becoming Alemannic territory. 
> 
> The area of Switzerland was incorporated into the Frankish Empire in the 6th century. 
> 
> In the High Middle Ages, 
> the eastern German-speaking part belonged to the Duchy of Swabia, Holy Roman Empire, 
> while the western French-speaking part was part of Burgundy.
>
> The Old Swiss Confederacy in the Late Middle Ages (the Eight Cantons) 
> established its independence from the House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Burgundy, 
> and in the Italian Wars gained territory south of the Alps from the Duchy of Milan. 
> 
> The Swiss Reformation divided the Confederacy 
> and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife 
> between the Thirteen Cantons in the Early Modern period. 
> 
> In the wake of the French Revolution, Switzerland fell to a French invasion in 1798 
> and was reformed into the Helvetic Republic, a French client state. 
> Napoleon's Act of Mediation in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a confederation, 
> and after the end of the Napoleonic period, 
> the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of turmoil 
> culminating in a brief civil war in 1847 and the creation of a federal constitution in 1848.
>
> The history of Switzerland since 1848 has been largely one of success and prosperity. 
> Industrialisation transformed the traditional agricultural economy, 
> and Swiss neutrality during the World Wars and the success of the banking industry 
> furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the world's most stable economies.
>
> Switzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the European Economic Community in 1972 
> and has participated in the process of European integration by way of bilateral treaties, 
> but it has notably resisted accession to the European Union (EU) 
> even though its territory almost completely (except for the microstate Liechtenstein) 
> has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995. 
> 
> In 2002, Switzerland joined the United Nations.
